     <p>I chose this cause because if I donâ€™t speak up for my people then nobody will.
         It is really important to me because  people in Tibet are being systematically oppressed 
         for practicing their tradition and religion by the Chinese government.
         Hence, ever since 1998 to this very day at least 153 Tibetan self-immolate to 
         peacefully protest against the lack of freedom and human rights in Tibet.</p>
